# YoutubeAutotranslateCanceler


I was annoyed by YouTube changing video titles to poorly auto-translated versions, so I made this script using YouTube Data API to retrive original titles and change them back.

Unfortunately, this requires an API key to work. However, requests to this API are free. You can browse to [Google's official support](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) in order to know how to get an API key.
